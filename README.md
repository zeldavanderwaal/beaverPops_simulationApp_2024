# a Beaver Population Simulation App
A shiny App developed by zelda van der Waal at the University of Newcastle (UK) for NatureScot, Natural Resource Wales, the Environment Agency and Natural England in 2024.

## About
As part of a beaver landscape modelling tender Newcastle University produced a desk-based tool to inform future beaver management decision-making with the aim to work with agencies in designing and producing a desk-based tool which applies the beaver population model and informs beaver management decision-making. The app was initially developed using the Beauly catchment (Scotland) as an example. It was extended to cover Scotland, England and Wales in 2024. 

A demo version is available here:
[a Beaver Population Simulation App - demo! ](https://naturalandenvironmentalscience.shinyapps.io/beaverApp_demo_v1/)

## App functionalities 
   - combine local beaver populations: locate existing beaver territories on the map, simulate translocations
   - landscape: modify habitat quality, incorporate barriers and management scenarios
   - simulate the growth of all local populations across the landscape
   - map probability of occupancy, create summaries over local areas and visualise trends through time

In-app documentation includes
   - instructions (user guide, tutorial videos)
   - description of the app functionalities (buttons, map legends)
   - summary of the assumptions and parameters within the models
   - help with output interpretation
   - suggestions for further documentation
   - literature and packages references
