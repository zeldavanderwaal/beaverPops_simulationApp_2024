# A Beaver Translocation Simulation App
A shiny App developed by zelda van der Waal at the University of Newcastle (UK) for NatureScot, Natural Resource Wales, the Environment Agency and Natural England in 2024.

## About
As part of a beaver landscape modelling tender Newcastle University produced a desk-based tool to inform future beaver management decision-making with the aim to work with agencies in designing and producing a desk-based tool which applies the beaver population model and informs beaver management decision-making. The app was initially developed using the Beauly catchment (Scotland) as an example. It was extended to cover Scotland, England and Wales in 2024.

In-app documentation includes: 
- instructions (general how to, initial simulation set-up)
- description of the app functionalities (buttons, map legends)
- summary of the assumptions and parameters within the models
- help with output interpretation
- suggestions for further documentation
- literature and packages references
